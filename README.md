This project uses computer vision and accurate hand detection to detect and display via image and text how many fingers are up on a hand on any present webcam. The finger images are also included.

Finger Counter:

This project uses your webcam and utilizes computer vision and hand detection to accurately predict how many
fingers are up. This works for either hand. It will display the number of how many fingers are up and a cartoon
image of how many fingers up. NOTE: the pictures are just a visual indicator of how many fingers up, the actual
picture does not correspond to the actual fingers up. Additionally, you can't use both hands at once, only one hand
at a time can be used.
